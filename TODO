Bug to fix:
1 -  Overview Section e.g: Images Card, Videos Card etc. are not the same icon size

2 - Version Retention Policy make work :D

3 - When a file to no have updated timeframe, only backup in .main_backup folder, in Select Backup is adding a Current File Version (Live), SHOULD NOT!
    show only the "Main Backup" button if not timeframe are available to be choose/clikced.
